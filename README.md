# bitRWA_frontend
> A trust-minimized, compliant, and capital-efficient way to bring RWAs—like tokenized T-Bills (e.g., BlackRock’s $BUIDL)—to **Bitcoin via Rootstock**, enabled by **Chainlink infrastructure**, **BitMask Wallet**, and **Ondo’s RWA stack**. This unlocks native BTC yield and Bitcoin-based DeFi for institutional and retail market participants.
